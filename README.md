# DigitalTwin
A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object, process, system, or environment that mirrors its real-world counterpart as closely as possible. This virtual model is constantly updated with data from sensors attached to the physical object, allowing it to reflect its current state and predict its future behavior.
